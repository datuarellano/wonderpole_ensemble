# Wonderpole Ensemble

The original Wonderpole is a homemade digital synthesizer in a unique pole form factor, and makes sound by responding to touch and orientation. It was envisioned by Datu Arellano (visual artist, musician, maker) and Malek Lopez (composer, music producer, electronic musician) in 2019 as part of an event organized by CREATE PH and Manila International Performing Arts Market.

**The Wonderpole Ensemble** is the open source, open hardware, workshop-friendly, and low cost, version of the original, and was designed in 2023. It is based on the Arduino Nano microcontroller board and the Mozzi sound synthesis library.

As an open source and educational project, the goal is to create a STEAM-based* learning platform that is open to people of a wide age range and a variety of skill sets. It encourages creativity, collaboration, and community.  

> *"STEAM Education is an approach to learning that uses Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics as access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue, and critical thinking." [More on STEAM](https://artsintegration.com/what-is-steam-education-in-k-12-schools/)
